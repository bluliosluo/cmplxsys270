        ">Rabbit reproduction is a positive feedback loop that causes the population of rabbits to grow exponentially. However, rabbits exist in an enviornment that contains finite resources (food, water, space). Therefore, the population of rabbits stops growing once those resources become scarce.\n",

We notice that when population grows, more and more people can reproduce and have children, which leads to a cycle of self reinforcing population growth. A limitation exsures that the positive feedback doesn't lead to infinite growth because some resources such as food, water, and space are not infinite. As the population reached the capacity of our environment, the population growth rate will decrease and uptimately reach a stable point. Thus, the positive feedback of population growth cannot last forever due to limited resources.  "
